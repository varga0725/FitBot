## üöÄ Getting Started

To run FitBot locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A code editor like VS Code with a live server extension (e.g., "Live Server").
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Running

This project is configured as a static site and does not require a traditional `npm install` or build step to run.

1.  **Clone or download the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitbot.git
    cd fitbot
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application is designed to be deployed on a platform where environment variables can be set. To run it locally, you must manually create a configuration file.

    *   Create a new file named `env.js` in the root of the project.
    *   Add the following content to `env.js`, replacing `YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key:
        ```javascript
        window.process = {
          env: {
            API_KEY: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY'
          }
        };
        ```
    *   Add a script tag to your `index.html` file to include this new file. Add it **before** the main `index.tsx` script:
        ```html
        <!-- index.html -->
        </head>
        <body class="bg-gray-900 text-gray-200">
          <div id="aurora-background"></div>
          <div id="root"></div>
          <script src="/env.js"></script> <!-- Add this line -->
          <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```

3.  **Start a local server:**
    *   Using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   Alternatively, use a simple command-line server:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Onboarding:** The user is first greeted with a setup form where they input their name, biometrics (age, gender, weight, height), fitness level, primary goal, and available equipment.
2.  **Plan Generation:** This profile is sent to the Gemini API, which generates a personalized 7-day JSON-structured workout plan.
3.  **Dashboard:** The user is then taken to the main dashboard, which defaults to the 'Workout Plan' view.
4.  **Interaction:** From here, the user can:
    *   View daily workouts and see exercise details.
    *   Log completed workouts, which updates their progress, streaks, and achievements.
    *   Switch to the 'Meal' tab to generate a nutrition plan.
    *   Switch to the 'Progress' tab to view their stats, calendar, and set goals.
    *   Chat with the FitBot AI for motivation or questions.
5.  **Persistence:** All user data, including the profile, plans, and logs, is stored in the browser's `localStorage`. This means the user's session is saved, and they can pick up where they left off without needing a backend or user accounts.
